My name is JeRon Fyfield and I am the Founder and CEO of JeRon Fyfield Photography. My love for photography started as a kid, but my first camera didn't come until my 18th birthday. I spent a couple years taking pictures as a hobby, but it wasn't until 2016 that I decided to pursue the professional photography route. My goal is to bring you <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">professional quality pictures</span> at a <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">family-friendly price.</span> <br/><br/>
So book J.F. Photography today, and <span style="font-style:italics;font-weight:bold;">"Lets Make Magic"!</span>
