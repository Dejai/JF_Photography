My name is JeRon Fyfield and I am the Founder and CEO of JeRon Fyfield Photography. My love for Photography started as a kid, but my first camera didnt come until my 18th birthday. I spent a couple years taking pictures as a hobby, but it wasnt until 2016 that I decided to pursue the Profesional Photography route. My goal is to bring Profesional Quality Pictures to you at a Family Friendly Price. So book J.F Photography and "Lets Make Magic"!
