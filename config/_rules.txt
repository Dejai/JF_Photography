*** Introduction ***
---------------------
The following are rules and details related to the files and folders that you can update to dynamically control your website. A configuration file is a simple .txt file that contains information about images and folders. See below for a description of the different ones. But first ...

-------------------------
*** THE GOLDEN RULES ***
-------------------------

Rule #1: Every custom configuration file should have a corresponding album folder in /gallery/. So for example, if you add a configuraiton file for 'myFirstAlbum.txt', there should be a folder in /gallery/ named myFirstAlbum. 

Rule #2: Each configuration file should follow the format described below in the *** DESCRIPTIONS OF CONFIGURATION FILES *** section. The scripts on the pages are based on you strictly following these formats! This includes the headers for each file, as well as the commas (and the space after the commas). 

Rule #3: The last line of data in your file should be the last line. Meaning, there should not be any empty lines after it. You can remove these by going to the end of the last line and hitting the 'Delete' / 'Remove' button. 


----------------------------------
*** THE FOLDERS YOU WOULD USE ***
----------------------------------

config: This is the folder that has the configuration files. You would be adding and editing them in this folder. 

images: This is the folder that has to do with anything that is an image - from the logo, to the slideshow images, album covers, and the actual images in the album. 

slideshow: This is found within the /images/ folder. This is where you put images that you want to be in the slideshow on the main page. 

gallery: This is found within the /images/ folder. This is where you put the other folders for the albums you want to show.
