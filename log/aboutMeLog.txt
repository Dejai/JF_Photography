      My name is JeRon Fyfield and I am the Founder and CEO of JeRon Fyfield 
      Photography. My love for photography started as a kid, but my first 
      camera didn't come until my 18th birthday. I spent a couple years taking 
      pictures as a hobby, but it wasn't until 2016 that I decided to pursue 
      the professional photography route. My goal is to bring you <span><b><font color="red">professional 
      quality pictures</font></b></span> at a <span><font color="red"><b>family-friendly 
      price.</b></font></span><br><br>So book J.F. Photography today, and <span><i><b>&quot;Lets 
      Make Magic&quot;!</b></i></span>
