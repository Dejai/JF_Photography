*** Introduction ***
---------------------
The following are rules and details related to the files and folders that you can update to manage the content on your website. A configuration file is a simple '.txt' file that contains information about images and folders. See below for a description of the different ones.


------------------------------------------
*** THE FOLDERS YOU WILL TYPICALLY USE ***
------------------------------------------

config: 
	This is the folder that has the configuration files. You would be adding and editing them in this folder. 

images: 
	This is the folder that has to do with anything that is an image - including the logo, the slideshow images, album covers, and the actual images in the album. 

slideshow:
	This is found within the /images/ folder. This is where you put images that you want to be in the slideshow on the main page. 

gallery: 
	This is also found within the /images/ folder. This is where you put other folders for the albums you want to show.



-------------------------
*** THE GOLDEN RULES ***
-------------------------

Rule #1: Every album folder in /gallery/ should have a corresponding configuration file. For example, if you add an album called 'Weddings', there should be a configuration file called 'weddings.txt'. 

Rule #2: Each configuration file should follow the format described below in the *** DESCRIPTIONS OF CONFIGURATION FILES *** section. Please be sure to leave the headers (i.e. the first row), and keep in mind commas and spaces. 

Rule #3: Try not to leave any empty lines at the end of your file. You can remove these by going to the end of the last line and hitting the 'Delete' / 'Remove' button.
