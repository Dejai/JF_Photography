VARIABLES
* For most variables, please use camelCase; This is my go-to, and I should be consistent
* It is only acceptable to include an underscore at the end of a variable name - WITHIN A FUNCTION!


FUNCTIONS
* Each function should have a description at the top. It should have the following format:
	/*
		@desc -- Shows the next image in the gallery slideshow (accounts for direction)
		@params -- The array of photos, the array of descriptions for the photos, the direction to go in the slideshow. 
	*/
